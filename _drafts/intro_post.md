As a long time technology enthusiast, I've wanted to start a blog for quite some time; however, I
have never felt anything I had to say was really all that worthy to put out there for others to
read. Also, being a self described tech enthusiast, I've always been just as interested in the
technology and platform as I was in the content. In the past, I had not been able to find the right
blogging platform that inspired me to get in and get my hands dirty. That is...until now.  Recently,
I've come across [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and
[github pages](https://pages.github.com)&mdash;and now here I am with my very own blog.

Well, maybe before I go too much further, it may be helpful to learn a little more about me.  I'm
a retired Naval Officer who served as a Naval Flight Officer and Information Professional during
my 20 year career. As a Naval Flight Officer, or NFO, I flew in the P-3C Orion conducting
maritime patrol operations and occassionally a little anti-submarine warfare.  I then transitioned
to the Information Professional Community where I served as a Carrier Strike Group Communications
Officer, a division chief of space operaations for the space functional component command of
U.S. Stategic Command, and the Director of Coporate Operations & Information Systems for the
Navy's lead organization for mine warfare.

One of the best things about jekyll is the number of freely available themes
that you can fork and begin using right away to make a good looking
right-out-of-the-box site. But where is the fun in that...? This site has been
implemented from the ground up, relying on only a few third-party
libraries&mdash;namely [jquery](https://jquery.com), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
and [font-awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome).
Yeah, I can hear you are saying that you can tell it has been implemented from
the ground up because of the apparent lack of design aesthetics. But I will
say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

The intent of the project is two-fold. While the idea of starting a blog to
have a platform to share my thoughts and challenges, and hopefully, share
how I may have managed to overcome those challenges, is a large motivator, I
think the greater motivator is challenge of creating the blog itself. I have
no doubt that I am going to learn a ton with this project, and that excites
me&mdash;so let's get to it!
