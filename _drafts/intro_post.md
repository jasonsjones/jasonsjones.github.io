As a long time technology enthusiast, I've wanted to start a blog for quite some time. However, I
have never felt anything I had to say was worth the time for others to read.  Also, being a
self-described tech enthusiast, I've always been just as interested in the technology and platform
as I was in the content. In the past, I had not been able to find the right blogging platform that
inspired me to get in and get my hands dirty. That is...until now.  Recently, I came across
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and
[github pages](https://pages.github.com)&mdash;and now here I am with my very own blog.

Well, before I go too much further, it may be helpful to know a little more about me.  I'm
a retired Naval Officer who, during my 20 year career, served as a Naval Flight Officer and
Information Professional. As a Naval Flight Officer, or NFO, I flew in the P-3C Orion conducting
maritime patrol operations and occassionally a little anti-submarine warfare.  After a few tours as
a NFO, I transitioned to the Information Professional Community where I had the opportunity to serve
as a Carrier Strike Group Communications Officer, a division chief of space operaations for the
space functional component command of U.S. Stategic Command, and as Director of Corporate
Operations & Information Systems for the Navy's lead organization for mine warfare.

Why did I transtion from NFO to Information Professional you ask...?  Well, although I mentioned
above that 'NFO' stands for _Naval Flight Officer_, some have said it actually stands for
_No Future Outside_&mdash;outside the Navy that is.  This is in large part because our expertise in
the aircraft is focused on tactics and the various weapons systems and their employment.  The pilots
are the ones that log all the mulit-engine flight time, which has an obvious one-to-one translation
in the civilian sector.

Although the above _No Future Outside_ description had some influence for the decision, it wasn't
the sole reason.  The main reason for the transition was because it was simply what I wanted to do.
For the first time in my career, up to that point, I was able to make a decision based soley on what
I wanted to do based on what aligned best with my interests and passions, which was a huge motivator.

The first job I had after I transitioned to the Information Professional Community was to attend
[Naval Postgraduate School](http://www.nps.edu) and join the [MOVES Institute](https://movesinstitute.org)
to study modeling, virtual environments, and simulation (MOVES).  The MOVES curiculum is best described
operations research.  It was during my studies at NPS that I found a passion for software
development.  Much of the early computer science programming courses were intented to be a means
to end, by that I mean, they were to teach the students, who all came from very diverse academic
backgrounds, the tools that they would need to effectively do the research and analysis for their
respective theses.  These courses also provided the foundation of knowledge for the students to be
best equipped to head out to their respective uniformed services or government agencies and manage
large scale modeling and simulation programs.

It was during my years at NPS that I began to think about what I wanted to do for my post-navy
career. What always seemed to came to mind, time after time, was how cool it would be to be able
to write code for a living. I started to think that maybe a career as a software engineer was what
I wanted to do.  The more and more I thought about it, the more I knew that becoming a software
engineer was what I wanted to do.  I also had the unwavering support from my wife as well, which
makes all the difference in the world.

With the decision made to become a software engineer after I retired from the Navy, the challenge
I now faced was how to best execute the transition from a career as a Naval Officer to that
of a software engineer.  How did I do it, you ask.  Well, I think the answer to that question is best
tackled in another blog post...
