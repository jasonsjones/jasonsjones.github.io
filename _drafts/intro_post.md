As a long time technology enthusiast, I've wanted to start a blog for quite some time; however, I
have never felt anything I had to say was really all that worthy to put out there for others to
read. Also, being a self described tech enthusiast, I've always been just as interested in the
technology and platform as I was in the content. In the past, I had not been able to find the right
blogging platform that inspired me to get in and get my hands dirty. That is...until now.  Recently,
I've come across [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and
[github pages](https://pages.github.com)&mdash;and now here I am with my very own blog.

Well, maybe before I go too much further, it may be helpful to know a little more about me.  I'm
a retired Naval Officer who, during my 20 year career, served as a Naval Flight Officer and
Information Professional. As a Naval Flight Officer, or NFO, I flew in the P-3C Orion conducting
maritime patrol operations and occassionally a little anti-submarine warfare.  After a few tours as
a NFO, I transitioned to the Information Professional Community where I had the opportunity to serve
as a Carrier Strike Group Communications Officer, a division chief of space operaations for the
space functional component command of U.S. Stategic Command, and as Director of Corporate
Operations & Information Systems for the Navy's lead organization for mine warfare.

Why did I transtion from NFO to Information Professional you ask...?  Well, although I mentioned
above that 'NFO' stands for _Naval Flight Officer_, some have said it actually stands for
_No Future Outside_&mdash;outside the Navy that is.  This is in large part because our expertise in
the aircraft is focused on tactics and the various weapons systems and their employment.  The pilots
are the ones that log all the mulit-engine flight time, which has an obvious one-to-one translation
in the civilian sector.

Although the above _No Future Outside_ description had some influence for the decision, it wasn't
the sole reason.  The main reason for the transition was because it was simply what I wanted to do.
For the first time in my career, up to that point, I was able to make a decision based soley on what
I wanted to do based on what aligned best with my interests and passions, which was a huge motivator.

The first job I had after I transitioned was to attend Naval Postgraduate School and join the
MOVES Institute to study modeling, virtual environments, and simulation (MOVES).  The MOVES curiculum
is best described as a mix of computer scienece and operations research.  It was during my
studies at NPS that I found a passion for software development.  Much of the early computer science
programming courses were intented to be a means to end, by that I mean, they were to teach the
students, who all came from very diverse academic backgrounds, the tools that they would need to
effectively do the research and analysis for their respective theses.  These courses also provided
the foundation of knowledge for the students to be best equipped to head out to their respective
uniformed services or government agencies and manage large scale modeling and simulation programs.

One of the best things about jekyll is the number of freely available themes
that you can fork and begin using right away to make a good looking
right-out-of-the-box site. But where is the fun in that...? This site has been
implemented from the ground up, relying on only a few third-party
libraries&mdash;namely [jquery](https://jquery.com), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
and [font-awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome).
Yeah, I can hear you are saying that you can tell it has been implemented from
the ground up because of the apparent lack of design aesthetics. But I will
say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

The intent of the project is two-fold. While the idea of starting a blog to
have a platform to share my thoughts and challenges, and hopefully, share
how I may have managed to overcome those challenges, is a large motivator, I
think the greater motivator is challenge of creating the blog itself. I have
no doubt that I am going to learn a ton with this project, and that excites
me&mdash;so let's get to it!
