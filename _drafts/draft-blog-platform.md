One of the best things about jekyll is the number of freely available themes
that you can fork and begin using right away to make a good looking
right-out-of-the-box site. But where is the fun in that...? This site has been
implemented from the ground up, relying on only a few third-party
libraries&mdash;namely [jquery](https://jquery.com), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
and [font-awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome).
Yeah, I can hear you are saying that you can tell it has been implemented from
the ground up because of the apparent lack of design aesthetics. But I will
say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

The intent of the project is two-fold. While the idea of starting a blog to
have a platform to share my thoughts and challenges, and hopefully, share
how I may have managed to overcome those challenges, is a large motivator, I
think the greater motivator is challenge of creating the blog itself. I have
no doubt that I am going to learn a ton with this project, and that excites
me&mdash;so let's get to it!
