            <h1>Jason S. Jones &mdash; Blog</h1>
            <h3>Glad you found your way here</h3>
            <p>

                As a long time technology enthusiast, I've wanted to
                start a blog for quite some time; however, I have never felt
                anything I had to say was really all that worthy to put out
                there for others to read.  Also, being a self described tech
                enthusiast, I am just as much interested in the technology and
                platform as I am in the content. Up until now I had not
                found a blogging platform that inspired me to get in and get my
                hands dirty.  That is...until recently.  I've come across
                <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, a static site
                generator, and <a href="https://pages.github.com">github pages</a>
                --and now here I am with my very own blog.

                One of the best things about jekyll is the number of freely
                available themes that you can fork and begin using right away
                to make a good looking right-out-of-the-box site. But where is
                the fun in that...? This site has been implemented from the
                ground up, relying on only a few third-party libraries--namely
                <a href="https://jquery.com">jquery</a>,
                <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>,
                <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css">animate.css</a>
                and
                <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome">font-awesome</a>.
                Yeah, I know you are probably saying that you
                can tell it has been implemented from the ground up because of
                the apparent lack of design aesthetics. But I will say that
                beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

                The intent of the project is two-fold. While the idea of
                starting a blog to have a platform to share my thoughts and
                challenges, and more importantly, share how I have managed to
                overcome those challenges (assuming I have) is a large
                motivator, I think the greater motivator is challenge of
                creating the blog itself. I have no doubt that I am going to
                learn a ton with this project, and that excites me--so let's get
                to it!
