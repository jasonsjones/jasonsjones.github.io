                <p>

                    As a long time technology enthusiast, I've wanted to start a blog for quite
                    some time; however, I have never felt anything I had to say was really all
                    that worthy to put out there for others to read. Also, being a self described
                    tech enthusiast, I am just as much interested in the technology and platform
                    as I am in the content. Up until now I had not found a blogging platform
                    that inspired me to get in and get my hands dirty. That is...until recently.
                    I've come across <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, a static site
                    generator, and <a href="https://pages.github.com">github pages</a>&mdash;and
                    now here I am with my very own blog.

                </p>
                <p>

                    One of the best things about jekyll is the number of freely available themes
                    that you can fork and begin using right away to make a good looking
                    right-out-of-the-box site. But where is the fun in that...? This site has been
                    implemented from the ground up, relying on only a few third-party
                    libraries&mdash;namely
                    <a href="https://jquery.com">jquery</a>,
                    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>, and
                    <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome">font-awesome</a>.
                    Yeah, I can hear you are saying that you can tell it has been implemented from
                    the ground up because of the apparent lack of design aesthetics. But I will
                    say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

                    The intent of the project is two-fold. While the idea of starting a blog to
                    have a platform to share my thoughts and challenges, and hopefully, share
                    how I may have managed to overcome those challenges, is a large motivator, I
                    think the greater motivator is challenge of creating the blog itself. I have
                    no doubt that I am going to learn a ton with this project, and that excites
                    me&mdash;so let's get to it!

                After having had the awesome experience and opportunity to serve, I now have the
                opportunity to follow my passion for software development and transition to a
                career as a software engineer. My interest is in full stack web application
                development, particulary the MEAN stack, which is comprised of MongoDB, ExpressJS,
                AngularJS, and Node.js.
