        <h3>Glad you found your way here</h3>
        <p>

            I've been a long time technology enthusiast and have wanted to
            start a blog for quite some time; however, I never felt I had
            anything to say that was worth the time to read.  Also, being a
            tech enthusiast, I am just as intersted in the technology and
            platform as I am in the content, and up until now I had not found a
            blogging platform that inspired me to get in and get my hands
            dirty.  That is...until recently. I've come across jekyll, a static
            site generator, and github pages--and now here I am with my very
            own blog.
