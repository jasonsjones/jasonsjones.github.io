            <h3>Glad you found your way here</h3>
            <p>

                I've been a long time technology enthusiast and have wanted to
                start a blog for quite some time; however, I never felt I had
                anything to say that was worth the time to read. Also, being a
                tech enthusiast, I am just as interested in the technology and
                platform as I am in the content, and up until now I had not
                found a blogging platform that inspired me to get in and get my
                hands dirty. That is...until recently. I've come across jekyll,
                a static site generator, and github pages--and now here I am
                with my very own blog.

                One of the great things about jekyll is the number of freely
                available themes that you can fork and begin using right away
                to make a good looking right-out-of-the-box site. But where is
                the fun in that...? This site has been implemented from the
                ground up, relying only on a few third-party files, namely
                jquery and font-awesome. Yeah, I know you are probably saying
                you can tell it has been implemented from the ground up because
                of the apparent lack of design aesthetics. But I will say that
                beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I wholeheartedly
                acknowledge that I am NOT a designer, nor am I claiming to be
                one.

            </p>

                The intent of the project is two-fold. While the idea of
                starting a blog and having a platform to share my thoughts and
                challenges, and more importantly, share how I have managed to
                overcome those challenges (assuming I have) is a large
                motivator, I think the greater motivator at this stage of the
                game, is challenge of creating the blog itself. I have no doubt
                that I am going to learn a ton on this journey, and that
                excites me--so let's get to it!
