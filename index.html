                As a long time technology enthusiast, I've wanted to
                start a blog for quite some time; however, I have never felt
                anything I had to say was really all that worthy to put out
                there for others to read.  Also, being a self described tech
                enthusiast, I am just as much interested in the technology and
                platform as I am in the content. Up until now I had not
                found a blogging platform that inspired me to get in and get my
                hands dirty.  That is...until recently.  I've come across
                <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, a static site
                generator, and <a href="https://pages.github.com">github pages</a>
                --and now here I am with my very own blog.

                One of the best things about jekyll is the number of freely
                available themes that you can fork and begin using right away
                to make a good looking right-out-of-the-box site. But where is
                the fun in that...? This site has been implemented from the
                ground up, relying on only a few third-party libraries--namely
                <a href="https://jquery.com">jquery</a>,
                <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>,
                and
                <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome">font-awesome</a>.
                Yeah, I can hear you are saying that you can tell it has been
                implemented from the ground up because of the apparent lack of
                design aesthetics. But I will say that beauty is in the eye of the
                beholder.

                The intent of the project is two-fold. While the idea of
                starting a blog to have a platform to share my thoughts and
                challenges, and hopefully, share how I may have managed to
                overcome those challenges, is a large motivator, I think the
                greater motivator is challenge of creating the blog itself. I
                have no doubt that I am going to learn a ton with this project,
                and that excites me--so let's get to it!

                After having had the awesome experience and opportunity to serve, I now have the
                opportunity to follow my passion for software developement and transition to
                a career as a software engineer.  My interest is in full stack web application
                developement, particulary the MEAN stack, which is comprised of MongoDB, ExpressJs,
                AngularJS, and Node.js.
